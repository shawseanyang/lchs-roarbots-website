                            We started our rookie season last year with no experience, no materials, but lots of motivation. New to this field, we all had to learn from the ground up how to design, build, code, and improve each subsystem that goes into creating a successful bot.
                            Evidently, this worked out well because we ended up at Worlds our first year!
                            We started this journey in 2018 with two competition teams and 10 people and we've since grown to five competition teams and 32 people in a little more than a year!

                            This was our ticket to Worlds. We actually gained our invitation to the State championships by an unexpected but generous invitation based on our Skills ranking. With so much at stake, the team worked hard night after night the week before. The robot that emerged from this focused frenzy was truly a <span class="italic">beast</span>, taking us to the semi-finalist tournament and earning us the opportunity to compete at the World championships.

                            Even though our performance at Worlds was decent, the real take-away was the experience of competing with the top robots in the world, gaining connections with talented coaches and students, and learning different approaches to each subsystem that helped us improve our design process for this season.

By mentoring them on robotics principles, teamwork, and the engineering design process, we have strengthened our own team bonds and lion spirit!

The goal is to return to Worlds each year to give every student the opportunity to experience the impact and reward of real world engineering. Our Rookie Roarboticists program is only the start of our community connection plans. In the upcoming months, we will visit our middle school campuses to inspire the next generation to pursue STEM. We can't wait!

                            This season, some of our members competed in the BEST Robotics Competition to "dip our paws in the water". To enable more students to participate in the magic of roarbotics, we will expand our participation in the BEST robotics competition next year. BEST challenges students to build a robot with limited, predetermined resources through innovation. The competition is set on a large field and the game mimics a real-world scenario.
