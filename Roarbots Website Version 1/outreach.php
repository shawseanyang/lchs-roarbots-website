                    With VEX, we are able to spread the magic of roarbotics. Through our Rookie Roarboticists training program, we mentor high school freshmen to prepare them for competitive robotics and beyond. The power of inspiration is only more impactful at a young age, so we've planned several upcoming presentations at our local middle schools. Being a young (but robust) robotics program two years in the making, we expect to greatly expand our outreach events even further in a few years' time.

                            Being rookies ourselves last year, we could appreciate the value of mentorship. Thus, we've established our Rookie Roarboticists training program. We work with our 16 rookie lions by teaching them the knowledge we wish we would've had in our starting year. By laying their foundations in subsystems like drive-base, structure, coding, navigation, and — most importantly — decoration, they will gain a running start. We hope to expand this program in the coming years to both generate exposure for robotics and learn mentorship skills ourselves.
