                    The VEX Robotics Competition challenges us to harness a diversity of skills, ethnicities, and backgrounds. We are a team of high school students (from sophomores to seniors), but we are also engineers, programmers, leaders, field coaches, and teammates — we even have an organizational specialist! Under the guidance of our coach, we <span class="italic">pride</span> ourselves on driving communication, cooperation, and excellence — along with our robots. We also mentor our rookie members who range from freshmen to sophomores and encompass all genders.

                    We are registered under three main competition teams: Roarbots 2854X, Y, and Z. Our rookie teams are grouped under Roarbots 2854V and W. Our teams are then divided into task divisions that focus on either the mechanical and software aspects of the build. Each team analyzes, designs, and organizes its own engineering design process but we all collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other. The more the merrier!

Though I'm one of the newer members, I have plenty of experience with programming and engineering. I have published several websites, including this one, piloted a plane, and conducted emergency climate research as a NASA SEES intern.

I have taken a lot of STEM courses in high school, and will be attending Texas A&M College of Engineering next year.
